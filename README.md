# nightride-cli

Nightride FM - the synthwaviest radio now inside your terminal, hackerman!!

![Demo](assets/demo.gif)

This client establishes a direct uplink to Nightride FM via global packet infrastructure (internet). Audio is streamed, decoded locally and sent directly to your machine's audio output using low-level access through Go's sound libraries.

Built for the command line frontier.
